- [Use Amazon Bedrock AgentCore built-in tools to interact with your applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/built-in-tools.html): Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides several built-in tools to enhance your development and testing experience. These tools are designed to help you interact with your application in various ways, providing capabilities for code execution and web browsing within the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore environment.
- [Code Interpreter API Reference Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-api-reference-examples.html): This section provides reference examples for common Code Interpreter operations using different approaches. Each example shows how to perform the same operation using AWS CLI, Boto3 SDK, and direct API calls.
- [Deleting an AgentCore Code Interpreter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-delete.html): When you no longer need a Code Interpreter, you can delete it to free up resources and avoid unnecessary charges.
- [Executing code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-execute-code.html): Once you have started a Code Interpreter session, you can execute code in the session.
- [Resource management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-resource-management.html): The AgentCore Code Interpreter provides two types of resources:
- [Resource and session management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-resource-session-management.html): The following topics show how the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter works and how you can create the resources and manage sessions.
- [Stopping a AgentCore Code Interpreter session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-stop-session.html): When you are finished using a Code Interpreter session, you should stop it to release resources and avoid unnecessary charges.
- [Listing AgentCore Code Interpreter tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-list.html): You can view a list of all your Code Interpreter tools to manage and monitor them.
- [Getting started with AgentCore Code Interpreter by running a hello world example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-getting-started.html): The following sections show how you can get started with the AgentCore Code Interpreter tool.
- [Read from or write files to a session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-file-operations.html): You can use the Code Interpreter to read and write files in the sandbox environment. This allows you to upload data files, process them with code, and retrieve the results.
- [Using Terminal Commands with an execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-s3-integration.html): You can create a custom Code Interpreter tool with an execution role to upload/download files from Amazon S3. This allows your code to interact with S3 buckets for storing and retrieving data.
- [Starting a AgentCore Code Interpreter session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-start-session.html): After creating a Code Interpreter, you can start a session to execute code.
- [Session management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-session-characteristics.html): The AgentCore Code Interpreter sessions have the following characteristics:
- [Execute code and analyze data using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-tool.html): Learn how to use the code interpreter built-in tool in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to execute code, analyze data.
