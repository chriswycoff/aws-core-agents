## AgentCore SDK
- [AgentCore Memory](https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit/blob/main/documentation/docs/user-guide/memory/quickstart.md): Learn about how to develop Memory using AgentCore SDK

## Examples
- [Consolidation prompts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory-consolidation-prompts.html): The consolidation step identifies if existing memories with the same namespace should be deleted or updated. AgentCore Memory checks that new memories are not duplicated or contradicting before merging them with existing memories. This is needed for Semantic or User Preference strategy. The below are sample prompts for consolidation. These can be used in "appendToPrompt" field in SemanticOverrideConsolidationConfiguration, UserPreferenceConsolidationConfiguration, or SummaryConsolidationConfiguration within CustomMemoryStrategy in
